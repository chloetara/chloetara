Below is the draft of my GitHub's presentation. I caught myself that it's a great idea - but, the time... don't have it... almost...

Then was a great leap to JS - Node.js ecosystem with the main goal of integration testing with Mocha and Chai.
This goal has been achieved - I have written the test suites for RESTful APIs with: Node.js+Mocha+Chai(+etc - npm-modules).
Then, recently I started to look for my own passion, and [...see below:]
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PostgreSQL. Meanwhile still learning JavaScript and Node.js ecosystem.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I like coding, and certainly would like to participate interesting projects!
- 📫 How to reach me - email - is a great idea: `chloinwrite@gmail.com` !
